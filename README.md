This project focuses on analyzing patient medical records to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Using a dataset containing features like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and exercise-induced factors, I explored the data through visualization and statistical analysis to identify patterns and relationships influencing heart disease. Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical variables to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors, were applied to predict heart disease. Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and the most impactful features were identified to help in early diagnosis. This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and predictive modeling in the healthcare domain to support data-driven medical decisions.
